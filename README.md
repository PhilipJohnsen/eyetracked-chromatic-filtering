# eyetracked-chromatic-filtering
A real-time eye-tracked chromatic filtering implementation for the prevention of myopia in children. 

This is a bachelors project developed at the University of Copenhagen, Data science Institute (DIKU). 

The project aims to use real-time eye-tracking and rendering to apply chromatic filtering that adjusts the composition of light on the screen, to prevent lengthening of the eye when viewing a screen for extended periods of time. The project relies on previous clinical results.

The aim of the project is to demonstrate and user-test the feasability of using screen based eye tracking to use chromatic filtering in the peripheral vision of the user, while not applying the filter to the center of the users gaze. 

The eye tracking technology used is from Tobii, a Swedish eye tracking hardware company.
